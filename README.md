# Tracktive
  Tracktive is a mobile app designed to encourage engagement with changes in the world.
  Want to get to grips with world events, on your terms? Tracktive helps you filter stories from hundreds of different news sources,
allowing you to track what’s going on, beyond the daily news cycle.
  Actively pursue and engage with issues. Build cards that search for keywords that you think are important.
  Bookmark any stories that you think will be important later on. Build a library of evidence and keep a diary of your thoughts.

  I wanted to develop an app that encourages us to think about how everyday life is a learning process. 
  The way that we consume news, with its emphasis on rolling coverage, often works against us taking time to think about longer trends,
the ‘bigger picture’.
  
  Tracktive uses the Event Registry API to pull stories from hundreds of news sources, based on the user's keywords. 

  Currently Tracktive is in the pre-alpha stage.
  
  Roadmap
  - Refine the diary function to make it a key feature. 
  - Build a 'shared card' function for people to share their keyword settings.
  - Provide more customisation options for cards - including language and news sources.
  - Develop a flagging system for potentially inaccurate news sources. 
  
  Disclosure: Tracktive was originally produced for the Udacity nanodegree capstone assessment.
